# Augmented Posters
Second assignment of the Virtual and Augmented Reality course of MIEIC-FEUP

This project comprises two modules: `prep` and `aug`.

The `prep` module allows the user to calibrate the camera and edit the image database used in the `aug` module.
The `aug` module is the actual augmented reality app which augments the film posters.

## Installation

Use the package manager pip3 to install dependencies.

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Running

On the root directory of the project run:

```bash
python3 -m prep
```

for the prep module and

```bash
python3 -m aug
```

for the `aug` module.
